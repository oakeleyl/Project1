            The Great Lakes piping plover has been classified as endangered since the 1980s. The USFWS listed it as endangered in the Great Lakes watersheds of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. 
The most common predators of the piping plover are gulls, rats, feral cats, foxes, and raccoons. Human activity near plover nests can attract predators when food scraps and other sorts of litter are left on the beach.
