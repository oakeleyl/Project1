    <h1>Chestnut-collared Longspur</h1>

    <p>Chestnut-collared longspurs are locally abundant breeding birds of the shortgrass and mixed-grass prairies of the Great Plains. They breed in shortgrass prairie with sparse, open vegetation. They can be found in grazed habitat rather than mowed or burned grassland. 
        During migration, chestnut-collared longspurs can be found in grasslands and cultivated fields. In winter, they can be found in desert grassland with short vegetation. Their wintering habitat includes deserts, grasslands, plateaus, and cultivated fields with a vegetation height of less than 0.5 m. 
        Chestnut-collared longspurs are whitish, marked with brown, black, and purple. They weigh between 0.02 and 0.02 kg.
