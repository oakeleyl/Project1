        <h1>Long-Tailed Duck</h1>
        
        <p>The long-tailed duck is a diving duck that favors saltwater in winter and Arctic tundra pools in summer. It has a small bill, round body, and short, pointed, dark wings. 
            It is 16.5 inches long, has a wingspan of 28 inches, and weighs 1.6 lbs. 
            The long-tailed duck has two mirror-image plumages: 
            In summer, the male is mostly black with a white face patch.
            In winter, the male is mostly white with rich brown, black, and gray on the face.
            The long-tailed duck is a talkative duck. 
             It has a population in the millions, but has declined seriously in some areas. Dense concentrations are vulnerable to oil spills and other pollution in northern seas. 
             Large numbers are sometimes caught and killed in fishing nets.
