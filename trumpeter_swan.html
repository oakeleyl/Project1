        <p>Adult swans have black bills and feet, while juveniles have pink bills and feet that turn black during their first year. 
            Trumpeter swans are native to North America and were introduced from Europe. 
            They are most common in forested regions, but were once also common on northern prairies. 
            Trumpeter swans are threatened by lead poisoning, collisions, illegal shooting, and habitat loss. 
           Trumpeter swans feed mostly on aquatic plants, but in winter they may also forage on waste grain and grasses in farm fields. 
           They breed in freshwater marshes and ponds. They favor large, shallow freshwater ponds or wide, slow-flowing rivers with lots of vegetation.
