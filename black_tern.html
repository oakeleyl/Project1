        <p>The Black Tern breeds in colonies in freshwater marshes and ponds. They build floating nests of plant matter. 
            In the summer, they live in freshwater marshes. In the winter, they become seabirds along tropical coasts. 
           The Black Tern eats insects and freshwater fish during the breeding season. The rest of the year, they eat small marine fish. 
           The Black Tern has been declining since the mid-1960s. In 2000, they were listed as an endangered species in New York State.
