        <h1>Marsh Wren</h1>
        
        <p>Marsh wrens have a stocky build with a long, narrow bill. They have black and white streaks on their backs, a brown cap, and a broad white eyeline with a black stripe above. 
            Their rumps are bright dark red, their throats and breasts are pale, and their flanks are reddish. 
            They have brown eyes, pale brown feet and legs, and a brownish bill. 
           Marsh wrens are often seen bouncing around with their tails cocked in marshes filled with cattails and rushes. 
           They grasp stalks of vegetation, legs splayed with each foot wrapped around a different stalk. Males occasionally pop up to sing from taller cattails.
