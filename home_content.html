            between the Chupadera Mountains to the west and the San Pascual Mountains to the east, the 57,331 acre Bosque
            del Apache was established in 1939 to provide a critical stopover site for migrating waterfowl. The refuge is
            well known for the tens of thousands of cranes, geese, and ducks who winter here each year. Over 30,000 acres of
