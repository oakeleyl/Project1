        <p>The hen harrier is also known as the northern harrier or marsh hawk. 
            It is a medium-sized harrier that flies low over open fields and marshes, listening for rodents lurking below. 
            The male hen harrier has pale grey plumage, a white rump, and black-tipped wings. 
            It weighs on average 0.39 kg. 
           The hen harrier is one of the rarest birds of prey. Persecution has led to a severe decline in their numbers.
            Northumberland is a key stronghold for hen harriers in England.
