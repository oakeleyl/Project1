    <p> Burrowing owls are active during the day and night. 
        They hunt for insects and small mammals, including mice, gophers, beetles, earwigs, and grasshoppers. 
        They are important to humans and the ecosystem because they consume agricultural pests and help prevent the spread of diseases. 
        The burrowing owl's scientific name comes from Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom, and the Latin word cunicularia, which means a miner or burrower. 
        The burrowing owl's population has been declining for many years due to: 
        Habitat loss
        Accidental mortality, such as being killed by cars
        Pesticide use
        Poisoning of prairie dog colonies
        In some areas, the burrowing owl is considered endangered or threatened.
