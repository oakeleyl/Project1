    <p>  Aquila chrysaetos belongs to the raptor family, which is a top predator in the food chain.  They mainly compete with other raptor species and top predators for lower species on the food chain.  The only predator the Golden Eagles have are humans and only indirect competition for land resources.
          The Eagles have an extensive list of prey ranging from turtles to reindeer.  This raptor is primarily responsible for controlling small bird and mammal populations such as owls, cranes, grouse, hedgehogs, marmot, hare, fox, as well as others in lightly wooded habitats
          These birds occupy a specific niche, but have also been known to take on much larger prey when the smaller prey is not available.  The trained Golden Eagles used by falconers have even been known to target large prey like gazelle, deer, goats, reindeer, and even wolf pups.
