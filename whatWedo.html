        <h1>Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge</h1>
        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <p>The National Wildlife Refuge System is a series of lands and waters owned and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Wildlife conservation is at the heart of the refuge system. 
            It drives everything we do from the purpose a refuge is established, to the recreational activities offered there, to the resource management tools we use. Selecting the right tools helps us ensure the survival of local plants and 
            animals and helps fulfill the purpose of the refuge. 
            Some of resource management tools used at Bosque del Apache include prescribed fire, moist soil management, exotic plant control, water level manipulation, and agricultural production.

        <p>Management and Conservation
            Refuges use a wide range of land management tools based on the best science available. The management tools used are aimed at ensuring a balanced conservation approach where both wildlife and people will benefit. At Bosque del Apache, 
            our conservation toolbox includes: prescribed burning, exotic plant control, moist soil management, farming, and water level manipulation. These tools help refuge staff manage the
             landscape as the Rio Grande historically did.  </p>

            The refuge uses gates and dams to flood and drain certain wetlands on seasonal schedules. Lowering water levels in marshes to create moist fields promotes growth of native marsh plants. 
            Marsh management is rotated so that varied habitats are always available. Dry impoundments are disced or burned, then re-flooded, to allow natural marsh plants to grow. When mature marsh conditions are reached, the cycle is repeated. 
            Wildlife foods grown this way include smartweed, millets, chufa, bulrush, and sedges.

            Many cottonwood and willow bosques that once lined the Rio Grande have been lost to human developments. Saltcedar or "tamarisk," originally introduced as an ornamental plant and for erosion control, has taken over vast areas. 
            It is a plant that has very little value to wildlife. Saltcedar is being cleared and areas are being planted with cottonwood, black willow, and understory plants to restore native bosques that are used by wildlife to nest, rest and feed.

            Irrigation canals ensure critical water flow. Daily monitoring, mowing, and clearing keeps them functioning. Controlling the water enables refuge staff to manage the habitat. Throughout the refuge, a network of small canals connects different 
            “moist soil units” with the region’s main water supply, which is a 57-mile canal that runs along the river. Each moist-soil unit can be flooded or drained as needed to grow the best mix of wetland plants to feed migrating birds. 
            With wetland plants hearty and thriving, a great diversity of native wildlife -- from prowling coyotes to year-round and migratory birds – continue to live in and around the wetlands.
